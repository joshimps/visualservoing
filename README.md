# Visual Servoing of a Handheld RGB-D Camera

The aim of this project is to use visual servoing techniques to control a Robot-held (Dobot or UR3) camera. 
The students can choose any pattern, and design any desired position on the image. 
When moving a fiducial/marker/object, the robot arm moves to point towards the fiducial/marker/object.

## Architecture and Equipment:
- UR3 Robot
- C++
- MATLAB
- ROS
- ROS Toolbox for MATLAB

## Sensors and Control for Mechatronic Systems Specifics

## Industrial Robotics Specifics
