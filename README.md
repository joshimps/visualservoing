# Visual servoing of a handheld RGB-D camera

The aim of this project is to use visual servoing techniques to control a Robot-held (Dobot or UR3) camera. 
The students can choose any pattern, and design any desired position on the image. 
When moving a fiducial/marker/object, the robot arm moves to point towards the fiducial/marker/object.
